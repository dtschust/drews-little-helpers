# Fastify Migration Notes

## Overview
- Replaced the Express server bootstrap with a Fastify instance in `index.js`, enabling `ignoreTrailingSlash` to retain Express-style route matching.
- Removed the `express` and `body-parser` dependencies and added `fastify`, `@fastify/cors`, and `@fastify/formbody` in `package.json` (and lockfile).
- Updated every route module in `src/` to use Fastify's `request`/`reply` APIs.
- Preserved functionality such as Slack interactions, Dropbox downloads, and the Feedbin proxy, adapting them to the Fastify ecosystem.
- Ensured linting passes via `npm test` (ESLint).

## Server Bootstrap (`index.js`)
- Instantiate Fastify with `fastify({ logger: false })`.
- Register the CORS and formbody plugins before attaching route modules.
- Expose the server on `process.env.PORT || 8000` using `fastify.listen`.
- Route modules are still imported once and invoked with the Fastify instance.

## Dependency Updates (`package.json` / `package-lock.json`)
- Removed `express` and `body-parser`.
- Added:
  - `fastify`
  - `@fastify/cors`
  - `@fastify/formbody`
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` after the dependency changes.

## Route Module Changes (selected highlights)
- General: Replaced `app.METHOD` with `fastify.METHOD`; Express `res` helpers migrated to `reply.code().send()`, `reply.type()`, etc.
- `src/fb-proxy-route.js`:
  - Maintains the `http-proxy` integration.
  - Uses `reply.hijack()` to hand control to the proxy and mirrors the previous body forwarding logic.
  - Preserves custom CORS handling for Feedbin requests.
- `src/ptp-slack-route.js`:
  - All Slack endpoints now validate tokens and respond using Fastify helpers.
  - The interactive payload flow remains unchanged aside from request object access.
- `src/movies-route.js`:
  - REST endpoints (`/movies/*`) now read from `request.query` / `request.body` and respond via `reply`.
  - Maintains async Dropbox integration with an arrow-function `provideFeedback` to appease ESLint.
- `src/podcast-feed-route.js`:
  - Serves the HTML index with explicit `text/html` content type.
  - Podcast XML responses continue to replace `S3_BUCKET_URL` tokens before returning.

## Testing & Validation
- Ran `npm test` to confirm ESLint passes with the new Fastify-based code.
- No runtime smoke test performed; advisable to run `npm start` (or the deployment process) to verify the Fastify server boots as expected.
